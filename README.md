# Assembler
In my Assembly course project, I successfully implemented an Assembler using Assembly language. The primary objective of this project was to delve into the complex process of translating assembly instructions into machine code, offering valuable insights into the inner mechanisms of computer systems and programming languages.

Within this project, I created a program capable of accepting assembly instructions as input and meticulously converting them into their corresponding machine code representations. This intricate process involved tasks such as parsing and analyzing the assembly instructions, mapping them to their respective opcodes, and generating the appropriate sequences of machine code.
